# Data manipulation

The current repo is a collection of examples that shows the use of Google Sheets through their API as well as data extraction from Facebook and Instagram using Selenium.

## Installation

We need two libraries in Python 3 to execute the following scripts.

#### 1. Create a pivot table using Google Sheets API
1) To start with, we need to activate the connection to Google Sheets, this is done through our Google account, once everything is set up we'll get a file (**credentials.json**) which will go along our script.

2) The next step is to install the Google Cloud APIs
```bash
pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib
```

If the previous steps has been completed successfully we'll be able to execute our scripts.


#### 2. Extract data from an Instagram Post

For this task we'll use Selenium which allow us to extract data dynamically simulating a web browser.

1) First, we proceed with the installation of selenium.
```bash
pip install selenium
```

2) Then, we need a driver to interact with our web browser, in this case I used Firefox. You can download the file from this [link](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases), and place the file in a directory where env variables have access to, for example: 

```bash
/usr/local/bin
```
Now, you're ready to test the code.

#### 3. Extract data from an Facebook Post

If you have successfully executed the previous example, then you don't need other libraries to run this example because it uses the same library as the second example (**Selenium**).
